# OpenBook Principles

## Transparency by default
All contributions, budgets, payouts, and refunds are recorded on-chain.

## Neutrality
OpenBook does not:
- sell visibility
- prioritize campaigns for payment
- influence funding decisions

## Minimal trust
- Smart contracts enforce fund movement
- Indexer and API are replaceable
- Frontend is non-authoritative

## Privacy minimization
- KYC handled by third-party provider
- No PII stored on-chain
- Platform stores attestations only

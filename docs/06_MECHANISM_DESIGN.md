# OpenBook Mechanism Design

## Task-first funding
Donors fund tasks, not unrestricted pools.

## Budget discovery
- Donors submit numeric budgets
- Vote weight based on contribution
- Final budget = weighted median

## Approval
Depends on v0 choice:
- Donor vote
- Reviewer approval
- Hybrid

## Refunds
- Eligible on rejection or timeout
- Pro-rata by contribution

# OpenBook Vision

## One-liner
OpenBook enables funding and spending to happen fully in the open, with verifiable budgets, task-based execution, and transparent payouts.

## Why OpenBook exists
Existing fundraising systems:
- obscure how funds are spent
- rely on trust in centralized operators
- bias discovery through paid promotion
- prevent independent verification

OpenBook removes these trust assumptions by making the ledger the source of truth.

## Core promises
- Anyone can fund what they believe in
- Anyone can verify where funds go
- No platform intermediary controls outcomes
- Budgets emerge from collective agreement, not authority

## Long-term direction
- v0: open task-based fundraising
- v1: delegation, reputation, better disputes
- v2: multi-ledger support
